First of all check out this post for full details and related Info.

## Hi Everyone 
My name is **Devang Saklani** and I am a freelance **Front-end Web developer** from INDIA. I like creating things like websites, animations and writing blogs.

I have been learning JS from few months and in first sight i loved it it's syntax, power and it's  uses. Then I got into touch with JS libraries for extra functionality like ReactJS and then I came across **AnimeJS**. I was amazed at first by it's syntax and it's power, it's a amazing animation library through which you can do simple as well as super complex animations.


## Now what I've made using AnimeJS:

I have made Some loading spinners using AnimeJS. These are some images/gifs:

Check out these **animations live** at [this website](https://animejs-spinners.web.app/) (hosted on firebase)

## Features (highlights):

 - Easy to use (simply copy & paste)
 - Source code is already **minified**
 - **Awesome animations**
 - 2 **themes** included (stroked and filled) and a theme switch button.
 - A **automation theme save** feature which saves your theme **even after page reload**.
 - A **Slider** for better UX and **keyboard compatible** (use arrow keys to navigate)

## Known issues

However this seriously needs some *improvement* and *optimisations*.. That's why I need your help in solving these bugs* and make some performance improvements.




### Known bugs:
 - Sometimes the code source viewer does'nt shows anything.
 - The CPU also gets 100% used when using a old computer and causing **frame drops** ðŸ˜¥.
 - and Many other small bugs that haven't discovered yet.
